	<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>I received my Bachelor's degree from Washington and Lee University in Virginia. I have a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Mathematics from Washington and Lee. At WLU, I participated in summer research as a Robert E. Lee Summer Scholar with <a href="http://home.wlu.edu/~levys/">Dr. Simon Levy.</a> Under Dr. Levy, as a first year, I worked to develop a Linux Software for controlling a Miniature Surveillance Vehicle. Two years later, we released <a href="http://home.wlu.edu/~levys/software/pyquadsim/">PyQuadSim</a>, an open source python program that enables users to fly a simulated MAV using a variety of controllers. Dr. Levy is still working with other students to produce cool research.</p>

	<h2>Personal</h2>
	<p>I am from Nepal, a beautiful country in South Asia. You probably know it as the home of the tallest mountain in the world, Mt. Everest. I left Nepal in 2011 to pursue my studies in the United States. As a student at Washington and Lee, I studied abroad in Ireland and Australia as an exchange student and loved every bit of it. It was a great experience that allowed me to meet new people, visit new places and learn new cultures. I also developed a love for travelling then, if I already didn't have it.</p>

	<p>When I'm not doing research, I like to play sports. I played a lot of cricket and soccer growing up. I also like to play squash and badminton. Nowadays, I boulder with my friends at the university gym and have been learning to ice skate. I have also been learning to juggle and play the guitar. </p>
